# Silhouette-for-Given-Distance-Matrix
Silhouette is used to be a metric to determine the best cluster possible. But this method in R packages couldn't handle given distance matrix, for example the matrix i formed from mixed type of data. In this occasion, i wanna share R codes to apply Silhouette method when we have our own distance matrix. 
The data toy i have here has small size just for the sake of understanding the whole concept of Silhouette. Enjoy the wave folks! I receive any critics and suggestions :)
