# Silhouette-for-Given-Distance-Matrix
Silhouette is used to be a metric to determine the best cluster possible. But this method couldn't handle the given matrix, for example the matrix i formed due to the mixed type of data. In this occasion, i wanna share R codes to apply Silhouette method even we have our own distance matrix.
The data toy i have here has small size just for the sake of understanding the whole concept of Silhouette. Enjoy the wave folks! I receive any critics and suggestions :)
