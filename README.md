# Silhouette-for-Given-Distance-Matrice
Silhouette is used to be a metric to determine the best cluster possible. But this method couldn't handle the given matrice, for example the matrice i formed due to the mixed type of data. In this occasion, i wanna share R codes to apply Silhouette method even we have our own distance matrice.
